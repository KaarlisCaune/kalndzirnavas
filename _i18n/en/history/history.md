Windmill "Kalndzirnavas," a high-power tower windmill, was initially built in 1814. Since then, the windmill has gone through several restorations.

From 1925, the mill was operated by Roberts Ozolants of Latvian descent. The mill produced groats and coarse flour, and it remained in operation until 1940.

In the mid-1980s, the Burtnieki parish council started but did not complete the restoration of the mill as a community center.

At the beginning of the 1990s, the Ozolanti family regained ownership of the windmill. Roberts Ozolants' heirs continue the upkeep and preservation of this site.
