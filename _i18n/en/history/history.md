Kalndzirnavas windmill, a high-power tower windmill, was initially built in 1814. The windmill has gone through several restorations.

From 1925, the mill was operated by Roberts Ozolants of Latvian descent. The mill produced groats and coarse flour, and was in operation until the 1950s.

In the mid-1980s, the Burtnieki parish council started but did not complete the restoration of the mill as a community center. 

At the beginning of 1990s, Ozolanti family regained the ownership of the windmill. Mill's heirs continue the upkeep and preservation of this site.
