In spring of 2020 the association Kalndzirnavas was established. Its goals are to restore and preserve the windmill as a part of the cultural landscape, as well as establish Kalndzirnavas as a site to meet and learn.

The association was awarded with support to create a spectating platform by the local municipality of Burtnieki district. Informative displays of the mills history and the surrounding landscape are located next to the mill. A website for the site was created.

We hope that everyone finds enjoyment here - may it be an attraction for tourists, rest stop for cyclists, a photo opportunity for newlyweds or anyone else.

In the future we plan to create a space for learning and creativity - open airs, seminars, creative workshops and excursions.

We are open to ideas and cooperation offers.
